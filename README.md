# :watch: PlankGrid for watchOS

*PlankGrid is an Apple Watch-based timer that tracks core mini-workouts.*

> :warning: **Warning:** Unmaintained and probably abandoned. It works fine, and there isn't a great need for improvement.

```swift
// All times are in seconds (NSTimeInterval)
var sources = [
    TimerDescription(name: "üëê Basic", duration: 65),
    TimerDescription(name: "üëà Left", duration: 45),
    TimerDescription(name: "üëâ Right", duration: 45),
    TimerDescription(name: "üí∫ Wall Sit", duration: 65),
]
```

Early in my time at [PlanGrid](https://www.plangrid.com), I built [a React Native app for our daily afternoon microworkout](https://github.com/ronaldsmartin/PlankGrid). It's a very specific timer in four parts.

By 2018, we'd increased the time for each segment (everyone got stronger through planking!), and I got an Apple Watch to dabble in watch app development. It's much better suited for this kind of app, and this version does the following:

* Counts down each segment of the PlankGrid workout (the ones defined in code above)
* Actually tracks the workout activity through your heart rate (as an indoor `.coreWorkout`) and sends the data to HealthKit :heart:
* Provides useful haptic feedback notifications during the last few seconds of a timer and when a timer completes, so you don't have to stare at the UI to know how far you are in the session. This was the #1 feature request for React Native PlankGrid for phones!
* The timer changes color at relevant points if you _are_ staring at it though, which is kinda nice.

## Usage
The UI is entirely watch-based. This was built before [Apple allowed Indepenent Watch apps](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2019/208/), so there's a corresponding host :iphone: app that you can just ignore.

* Start/pause the timer by tapping on the watchface.
* Switch between segments/timers by swiping left or right across the watch (in case you join late! Or, are injured.)
* Reset the current timer by long-pressing the watchface.

## Building and running locally

1. Download Xcode
2. Check out the repo
3. `$ open PlankGrid.xcodeproj`
4. Select the `PlankGrid WatchKit App` target and your device, and press **Play**.

### Notes about the code

I hacked this together over the course of <= 2h in 2018 and haven't looked at it since then, so please forgive the code quality!

* Timing logic lives in [TimerManager](https://github.com/ronaldsmartin/PlankGrid-watchOS/blob/master/PlankGrid/Model/TimerManager.swift). It's all hard-coded.
* The view and gesture recognizers are defined in [the WatchKit app's storyboard](https://github.com/ronaldsmartin/PlankGrid-watchOS/blob/master/PlankGrid%20WatchKit%20App/Base.lproj/Interface.storyboard).
* UI interaction logic lives in the [InterfaceController](https://github.com/ronaldsmartin/PlankGrid-watchOS/blob/master/PlankGrid%20WatchKit%20Extension/InterfaceController.swift).
